Purpose - The purpose of this project was to compare the price variation in the products available on Amazon 
and find the opportune momement to buy the products you are looking for.
Specifics - I created this project because I was looking for a WD Portable Hard Drive and I thought it would 
be a good idea to build some script, which will periodically scrape the data from website, compare the prices
from previous days and send me an alert if there is a price drop.
Success/Failure - i indeep got a new hard drive for 300 bucks lower than the previously asked price.
